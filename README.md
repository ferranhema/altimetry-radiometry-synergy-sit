# Altimetry-Radiometry Synergy for Sea Ice Thickness Retrieval

This repository implements a synergistic methodology for retrieving thin Sea Ice Thickness (SIT) by combining **Active Ku-band Radar Altimetry** (e.g., CryoSat-2) and **Passive L-band Radiometry** (e.g., SMOS/SMAP). The approach integrates physical radiative transfer modeling with machine learning (Random Forest) to constrain dielectric properties and estimate thickness.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. Data Processing & Generation
Scripts responsible for co-locating geophysical data and generating training maps.

* **`indexs_regrid.py`**
    * **Function:** Computes nearest-neighbor indices to regrid disparate datasets (TOPAZ, TSURF/CMEMS, SIC) onto the SMOS EASE-Grid. Uses `haversine_distance` to co-locate pixels from different satellite/model grids.
* **`map_generation.py`**
    * **Function:** Generates the `.npy` spatial maps used for training the RF-sit model.
    * **Workflow:**
        1.  Loads regridded geophysical parameters.
        2.  Computes empirical sea ice salinity using `sice_empirical.py`.
        3.  Calculates theoretical permittivity using `ellipsoids_perm.py`.
        4.  **Physics Inversion:** Runs the **Inverse Burke Model** (`d_retrieved_burke_solver_ep`) on every pixel to generate a "reference" thickness based on the physical radiative transfer model.
        5.  Saves a 7-channel `.npy` map containing the reference thickness, radiometric intensity, and physical state variables.

### 2. Machine Learning Modules
Scripts for training the retrieval algorithms (RF-synergy = RF-eps + RF-sit).

* **`rf-eps_training.py`**
    * **Goal:** Train a Random Forest (`RF-eps`) to retrieve **Sea Ice Permittivity** ($\epsilon$) from Altimetry Backscatter.
    * **Method:** Generates a synthetic dataset using the **SMRT (Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer)** model to simulate backscatter ($\sigma^0$) for various ice microstructures (`ellipsoids_perm`) and surface roughness.
    * **Output:** A regressor mapping complex permittivity.
* **`rf-sit_training.py`**
    * **Goal:** Train a Random Forest (`RF-sit`) to estimate **Sea Ice Thickness**.
    * **Method:** Loads the maps generated by `map_generation.py`. It trains a model to predict the physics-inverted thickness based on radiometric intensity, temperature, salinity, snow presence and permittivity.
    * **Output:** A regressor mapping sea ice thickness.

### 3. Physical Models
Underlying physical formulations used for simulations and inversions.

* **`burke_model.py`**
    * **Description:** Implementation of the **Burke et al. (1979)** incoherent radiative transfer model.
    * **Capabilities:**
        * Forward Model (`burke_model_ep`): Computes Brightness Temperature ($T_B$) for 3-layer (Air-Ice-Water) or 4-layer (Air-Snow-Ice-Water) media.
        * Inverse Solver (`d_retrieved_burke_solver_ep`): Retrieves ice thickness given an observed $T_B$.
* **`ellipsoids_perm.py`**
    * **Description:** Computes the effective complex permittivity of sea ice by modeling brine inclusions as ellipsoids.
    * **Formulations:** Supports Maxwell-Garnett, Coherent Potential, and Polder-van Santen mixing formulations.
* **`permittivity_models.py`**
    * **Description:** Empirical dielectric models for **Snow** (density/temperature dependent) and **Sea Water** (Double-Debye model).
* **`sice_empirical.py`**
    * **Description:** Calculates sea ice salinity based on ice thickness and sea water salinity using an empirical exponential formula.
